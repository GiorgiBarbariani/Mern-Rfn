## About this Tutorial

This tutorial will guide you through the process of building a fully-functional CRUD app using **refine**. From setting up your development environment to launching your app, you will learn all the necessary steps to get started with **refine**. üöÄ

We'll cover the following topics:

-   Setting up your development environment
-   Create your first **refine** app
-   Understanding [`dataProvider`](/docs/api-reference/core/providers/data-provider/)
-   The concept of resources [`resources`](docs/api-reference/core/components/refine-config.md#resources)
-   Adding CRUD pages
<!-- -   Understanding the `authProvider` -->

:::note
If you would rather start exploring **refine** with some examples before diving in, visit our [examples](/docs/examples/) page and choose an example to open and explore it in an online editor.
