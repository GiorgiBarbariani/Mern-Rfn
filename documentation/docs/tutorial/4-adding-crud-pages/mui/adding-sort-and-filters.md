In the previous [Adding List Page](/docs/tutorial/adding-crud-pages/mui/index) section, we have displayed products data in a table using the `<DataGrid/>`. This component includes built-in support for sorting and filtering, so you don't have to manually add these features.

When you click arrow icons on the table header, it will sort the data by the column you clicked. You can also filter the data by clicking the menu icon on the table header and selecting the filter.

:::tip
To see how the filtering and sorting work and more detail, you can refer to the [`useDataGrid` documentation](/docs/api-reference/mui/hooks/useDataGrid/).
