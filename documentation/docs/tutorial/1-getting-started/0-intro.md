<h3>Where are we going?</h3>

In this unit, we will be covering the following steps:

-   Setting up your development environment.
-   Creating a new project.
-   Generating CRUD pages for your data model.
-   Store your project in a git repository.
-   Deploy your project to the cloud.

As you make changes to your project, you can commit them to your GitHub repository. Netlify listens for changes to your GitHub repository to automatically rebuild and deploy your application on every commit. This allows anyone to access and view your website updates as you make them.
